This is base project for Next.js.  
It is only used for me.  

When you start Next.js project, you can exec following commands:  

- git clone https://github.com/rmblankslash/next-base-for-private.git
- ``npm install`` or ``yarn install``
- Deploy to any PaaS (Vercel, Heroku, AWS Amplify, etc...)

Also you can specify some ``og:***`` tag value editing ``./modules/site-info.js``.
